## Seedr - an online torrent leeching website

# Seedr

An online torrent client that works just fine in almost every network across the globe. They also provide torrent streaming features and there are options for non-premium and premium users separately. Seedr.cc is a great alternative and a much better user-friendly website than [FileStream](https://filestream.me) and [ZbigZ](https://zbigz.com). You can use Internet Download Manager (IDM) to download cached torrents from Seedr. The best part is that you can delete the torrents from the server whenever finished downloading, and get your space back for more torrents!

You can buy a premium account to further enhance your experience. Then you will be able to download more than one torrent in parallel, also the size will not be limited to 2 GB.

Seedr is a next-generation app aiming to bring the torrent experience to the next level.

Stream movies, music, and books on any device With top-in-class streaming technology, Seedr allows you to watch movies, listen to music, or read anything in your torrent library directly from the cloud on any device.

### Private and safe
Seedr has high-level transport encryption to protect your privacy, and there is no need to worry about malware, viruses, or outside tracking – Seedr is the barrier protecting you.

### Very fast
Seedr runs on a high-speed backbone and can fetch torrents to the cloud within several minutes down to several seconds.
If you’ve ever tried using torrents on either tablet or phone, you’d quickly find out how impractical it is. Seedr is the solution – with special mobile-friendly protocols, Seedr has created a snappy, fast mobile site that has all the functions you get on your PC – including streaming, subtitles, and high-speed direct downloads.
They believe that downloading torrents can be friendlier and safer, and plan on expanding the already rich features of the site in the near future.

### Overall
Easier to operate than uTorrent (by a long way), Seedr’s beauty lies in its simplicity. It’s hard to imagine anyone other than complete novices needing to revert to the site’s tutorial. However, those that do won’t be disappointed as it reveals ways to integrate the service into Kodi/XBMC. Free tier aside (which is a steal) it’s not cheap at $9.95 per month (two months free on annual rates) so the service might benefit from having a more limited lower-tier premium package around the $6 to $7 mark. Those who obsess over the minutiae of their torrenting might prefer a full-blown seedbox experience, but Seedr knows its target audience and appears to serve them well.
